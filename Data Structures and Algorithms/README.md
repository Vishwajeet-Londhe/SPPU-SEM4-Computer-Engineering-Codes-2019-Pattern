    <td>Consider a telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
telephone numbers (Python)</td>

using chaining with / without replacement.<br>
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys
must be unique Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key) (python)</td>

ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root <br>
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree <br>
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every
node <br>

    <td>There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take
to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a
graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency
list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.</td>

up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to
connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with
a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.</td>
